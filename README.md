# INVISIBILITY-CLOAK-

If you are a Harry Potter fan, you would know what an Invisibility Cloak is. Yes! Itâ€™s the cloak that makes Harry Potter invisible. I made this happen with a few line of python code in OpenCV. This technique is opposite to the Green Screening. In green screening, we remove background but here we will remove the foreground frame. It will be based on the image processing approach i.e. color detection and masking which means it will work for some particular colors as per our choice.
